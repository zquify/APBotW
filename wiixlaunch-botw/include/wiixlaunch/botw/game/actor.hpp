    // tracking the model and brings its own sub-actors along (a sword spawns
    // its sheath, which the game then cleans up itself). Actor::Delete removes
    // any of them cleanly. Nothing extra is needed to make this happen.

    // Actors that the game never places in the world do not. Armour is the
    // clear case: an Armor_* actor binds to a skeleton - the player's, or the
    // pause menu doll's - and nothing in the game ever creates one as a
    // free-standing world actor. Spawn one and it *renders*, which makes it
    // look like it worked, but it has no world lifecycle:
    //
    //   * Writing the proc's position moves the field and not the model.
    //   * Deleting the proc destroys it - confirmed by watching its memory get
    //     handed to another actor - and the model stays on screen.
    //
    // That is not a fault in this code. Such an actor is created correctly:
    // compared field for field against the armour the pause menu builds, ours
    // matches on state, job bits, flags, vtable and unit, both at creation and
    // at deletion. There is simply no teardown path for a world armour model,
    // because the game never makes one.
    //
    // So: fine for weapons, animals, enemies, NPCs, props. For armour, expect
    // a model that renders once and can never be moved or removed.
    //
    // Armour also never leaves the Sleep state - it goes Init -> Sleep and
