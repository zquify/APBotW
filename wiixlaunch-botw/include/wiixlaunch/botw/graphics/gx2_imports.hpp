// Resolving real GX2 functions from the Cemu raw code-cave build
// specifically - WIIXL_WIIU (real Aroma/wups plugin) needs none of this, it
// links against wut's gx2.rpl import stubs normally.
//
// The problem this solves: our Cemu payload is a raw, self-relocating blob
// dropped into a code cave (see wiixl_cemu_backend.hpp/main.cpp's
// WiiXLaunch_Cemu_Init) - it is never loaded as a real RPL module, so there
// is no OS import-resolution for anything it calls. BotW's own GX2 calls
// turned out to go through an internal display-list-recording wrapper, not
// a plain resolved function pointer, so there was nothing to "borrow" the
// way NVN's GOT cells were borrowed on Switch.
//
// The real, working mechanism (confirmed against a real installed Cemu
// graphic pack - BreathOfTheWild/Mods/FPS++/patch_VSync.asm, which calls
// `bl import.gx2.GX2SetSwapInterval`): Cemu's OWN patch/codecave assembler
// understands `import.<lib>.<FunctionName>` labels and resolves them to the
// real function address itself, at patch-load time. We can't get our
// GCC-compiled payload to emit that syntax directly, but we CAN place a
// small, hand-written .asm block (see src/cemu/gx2_imports.asm in this same
// module, which scripts/deploy.py auto-includes into the same codecave as
// the compiled payload) containing one tiny tail-call shim per GX2 function
// we need, plus a table of their resolved addresses. Our C++ code just reads
// real, Cemu-resolved function pointers out of that table.
//
// Locating the table: it's placed somewhere after our compiled payload's
// bytes within the same codecave (see deploy.py's per-file offset-symbol
// patching), so its address is g_CodeCaveBase + g_Gx2ShimTableOffset.
// deploy.py finds this exact global (matched via the
// "WIIXL_OFFSET_SYMBOL: g_Gx2ShimTableOffset" comment in gx2_imports.asm)
// and patches its deploy-time-computed offset into the flat binary before
// embedding it, the same way it already patches ADDR32/ADDR16 relocations
// elsewhere in the same payload.
//
// Logging (OSReport) used to live in this same table - it's been split out
// to cemu_logging.hpp/cemu_logging.asm, its own separate shim table, since
// it's a coreinit concern rather than a gx2 one.
