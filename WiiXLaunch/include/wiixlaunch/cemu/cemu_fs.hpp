// Resolving coreinit's filesystem APIs from the Cemu raw code-cave build, via
// the same import shim table mechanism as cemu_logging.hpp / cemu_mem.hpp -
// the payload is a raw codecave blob, never a real RPL module, so there is no
// OS import resolution for anything it calls, and every coreinit entry point
// has to be reached through a Cemu-assembled tail call in
// src/cemu/cemu_fs.asm.
//
// This is base-framework plumbing, not game-specific: these are coreinit
// exports present in every Wii U title and need no game address to reach. The
// module loader reads .wxlm blobs off the title's filesystem, so base
// WiiXLaunch depends on these directly and they cannot be behind "did someone
// install a game module".
