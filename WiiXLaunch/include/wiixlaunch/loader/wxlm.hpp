// The .wxlm module format.
//
// A mod ships as a relocatable blob with no source available, and this is the
// contract between the writer (scripts/wxlm.py) and the loader
// (wiixlaunch/loader/loader.hpp). Both implement this file; neither may drift
// from it, so every field has a fixed width and the struct carries
// static_asserts on its size and offsets.
//
// LAYOUT. One header, then sections located by offset from the start of file:
//
//   header    this struct, fixed size
//   payload   the mod's code and data, linked at 0
//   relocs    (kind << 24 | offset, value) pairs - the same encoding
//             scripts/deploy.py already emits for the host itself
//   imports   (surface, symbol) requirements and the sites that need them
//   exports   symbol hash -> offset, for inter-mod dependencies
//   required  surfaces the module needs as a whole
//   strings   a blob every name in the tables indexes into
//
// WHY A STRING BLOB rather than inline names: an entry stays fixed-width so the
// loader can walk a table without parsing, and surface names repeat across
// entries. Offsets into one blob keep entries uniform and the file small.
//
// ENDIANNESS AND MACHINE are explicit and checked before anything else is
// interpreted. The same mod id and version will exist for Wii U (big-endian
// PowerPC) and Switch (little-endian AArch64), and loading the wrong one would
// relocate garbage into executable memory.
//
// INTEGRITY. The realistic corruption is not a truncated file but a
// PARTIALLY-WRITTEN one: a user drags a mod into the folder and the copy is
// interrupted, leaving a file of the right length whose tail is stale or zero.
// Length checks cannot see that. The whole point of "skip it, log it, keep
// going" is that the loader can tell corrupt from valid BEFORE it relocates, so
// the header carries fileSize and a CRC32 over everything after the header.
//
// RESERVED FIELDS MUST BE ZERO, AND THE LOADER REJECTS NON-ZERO. Reserved-and-
// checked is a compatibility mechanism; reserved-and-ignored is a future bug -
// a newer writer sets a field, an older loader ignores it, and the mod
// half-works instead of failing cleanly. Failing cleanly is the contract.
