:: These used to be bare names - `call build_switch.bat` - which relies on cmd
:: searching the CURRENT DIRECTORY for the command. That search is disabled on
:: any machine with NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath set, and on such a
:: machine this script died on its very first call with
::
::   'build_switch.bat' is not recognized as an internal or external command
::
:: - which means build_all.bat had never once run to completion here. The three
:: individual scripts passing is a DIFFERENT CLAIM from build_all passing, and
:: the difference is the same shape as tools/format_test sitting unwired from
:: 73596ed: something that looks like it runs and does not. scripts/audit_gates.py
:: now refuses a bare invocation here so it cannot come back.

:: cd /d as well as the qualified paths, because the sub-scripts use relative
