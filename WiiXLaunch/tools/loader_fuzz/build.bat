::   0  the fuzzer ran and passed
::   1  the fuzzer ran and FAILED, or would not compile
::   2  no C++ toolchain on this machine, so it did not run
::
:: 2 is separated from 1 on purpose. A test that quietly vanishes on a machine
:: without a toolchain is worse than no test, because the build still says OK -
:: so the caller turns 2 into a loud warning rather than silence.
