// WiiXLaunch::BotW::Heap - allocating out of the GAME's memory instead of the
// payload's own.
//
// The Cemu payload's built-in heap is the tail of the code cave it was loaded
// into: it starts after the payload and ends at 0x01C00000, the end of Cemu's
// code-cave area (see wiixl_cemu_backend.hpp, which documents why it is NOT
// 0x02000000 - the gap above 0x01C00000 is unmapped and allocating into it
// dies silently on the first write). The whole area is 4 MB, shared with any
// other WiiXLaunch payload, and nothing frees. A mod that wants more
// than that - several font faces, large render targets, a mesh buffer - has to
// get it from somewhere else, and the game is already holding a MEM1 heap.
//
// BotW has a wrapper for exactly that at 0x0309BB68. Disassembled (v208):
//
//     mfspr r0,LR ; stwu r1,-0x10(r1) ; ... r31 = r3, r30 = r4
//     li    r3,0x0
//     bl    0x04004fb8        ; base heap handle 0 = MEM1
//     or    r4,r31 ; or r5,r30
//     bl    0x04004f70        ; allocate(handle, size, align)
//     ... blr                 ; r3 falls through as the return
//
// so it is `void* (uint32_t size, uint32_t align)`. This is not a new risk in
// kind: the Wii U build of GX2::AllocMEM1 has always called this same address
// directly, and Cemu runs the same RPX at the same addresses, which is why the
// GX2 hook at 0x03a75d48 works.
//
// It is opt-in because it cannot be right for everyone: the address is v208's,
// the game's heaps do not exist during early boot, and a mod that stays inside
// the code cave should not pay for this. See UseGameHeap() for when to call it.

// MEASURED, v208, from the title screen onwards: this DOES NOT WORK, and the

// own heaps during boot, so the MEM1 BASE heap - the one handle 0 returns - has
// nothing left and the allocation comes back null.
//
// Use WiiXLaunch::Mem::UseCoreinitHeap() instead (wiixlaunch/mem.hpp). It asks
// coreinit for the MEM2 base heap, which on this title reports ~68 MB free, and
// it needs no game-specific address at all. This function is kept because the
// wrapper is correct and a different title or an earlier moment may still have
// MEM1 room, but it is not the one to reach for.
//
// Route every later Arena::AllocHost - and so every GX2::AllocMEM1 - through
// the game MEM1 heap instead of the payload code cave.
//
// HOST allocations only. A loaded mod grant is never redirected: it holds
// relocated code that gets executed, and the code cave is the only region this
// project has established is executable.
//
// WHEN: after the game's heaps exist. From a GX2::OnInitialized callback or
// later is safe; from a module entry point it is not - the payload's entry hook
// runs long before coreinit has set the base heaps up, and the probe below will
// simply fail there.
//
// Allocations already handed out by the arena stay valid; nothing is freed or
// moved. Arena::HostUsed() keeps reporting the arena own share only.
//
// Probes with a small allocation first and refuses to install if it comes back
// null, so a bad address or an early call fails here rather than at the first
// texture. The probe's 256 bytes are deliberately leaked.
//
