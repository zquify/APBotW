// BotW's load point nomination.
//
// The load point is a per-game, per-platform fact, so base WiiXLaunch cannot
// know it - it owns the mechanism and never the address. Including this header
// is what nominates BotW's. A host with no game module installed nominates
// nothing, deploy.py emits no `.origin`, and it says so rather than producing a
// host that boots and silently loads no mods.
//
// WHY THIS ADDRESS (v208 Wii U RPX, read in Ghidra):
//
//   FUN_03098928 is the game's FS bring-up, and is also the function the Cemu
//   entry hook already sits on. It runs exactly once - FUN_03098a64 wraps it in
//   an `if (singleton == 0)` guard - and internally does:
//
//     030989bc  bl 0x04004ed0     FSInit()
//     030989c0  addi r3,r31,0x24  client = this + 0x24
//     030989c4  li   r4,0
//     030989c8  bl 0x04004e78     FSAddClient(client, 0)
//     030989cc  lis  r11,0x30a    <- LOAD POINT
//
// There is no cleaner site: the instruction after FUN_03098a64 returns is a
// vtable dispatch (0309f284 bctrl), so any post-FS-init point is necessarily
// mid-function.
//
// WHY NOMINATE AT ALL, given the Cemu probe found FS already usable at the
// entry hook itself: that result is emulator-specific. Cemu HLEs coreinit, so
// the filesystem is live from process start and the game's own FSInit concerns
// the game's client rather than the subsystem. Aroma runs against real IOSU and
// Switch has its own romfs mount timing; neither has been probed. Nomination is
// the only mechanism validated for the case where FS is genuinely not ready
// early, which is exactly what those two may turn out to be. See
// docs/loader.md in base WiiXLaunch.
//
// THE BRANCH IS EMITTED BY THE PACK, NOT WRITTEN AT RUNTIME. deploy.py puts
// `.origin = 0x030989CC / b wiixlaunch_loadpoint_stub` in patch_*.asm next to
// the entry hook. Writing it from WiiXLaunch_Init would mean modifying code
// inside a function Cemu may already have recompiled on entry at 0x03098928,
// and it would break the rule that only the host pack writes into game memory.
//
// SAFETY OF THE SITE, checked rather than assumed: nothing xrefs 0x030989CC, so
// the branch cannot be landed on from elsewhere, and the displaced instruction
// is position-independent (`lis r11,0x30a` - no relative branch, no PC-relative
// addressing), so it re-executes correctly from the codecave. Its pair, the
// `subi r11,r11,0x7880` at 0x030989D4 that completes the address load, is one
// instruction past the return address and is left untouched.
