// botw.player v1 - this module's export surface for compiled mods.
//
// Small on purpose, but not a token: it is here to exercise the two parts of
// the ABI most likely to break, not merely to prove that registration works.
//
//   1. AN OPAQUE HANDLE CROSSES THE BOUNDARY. Player::GetEquippedSword()
//      returns `Actor` BY VALUE, and Actor is {void*, Kind} - exactly the trap
//      surface.hpp warns about. A mod compiled against one layout and run
//      against a host built from another would read a different field with no
//      build error anywhere. So Actor never crosses. The surface hands out an
//      ActorHandle: an integer the host understands and the mod cannot
//      dereference, passed back in to every accessor.
//
//   2. CALLS RETURN DATA, not just perform actions. ActorGetName fills a
//      caller-owned buffer and returns the length; GetPosition writes three
//      floats through a pointer. Both are the shape every future data-returning
//      surface call has to use, since neither a struct nor a std::string may
//      cross.
//
// HANDLES ARE GENERATION-COUNTED, and the reason is about diagnosis as much as
// safety. An actor can despawn between a mod taking a handle and using it. With
// the naive design - the handle IS the pointer - that use-after-despawn becomes
// a dereference of freed memory INSIDE THE HOST. The crash lands in host code,
// reads as a host bug, and gets reported as one.
//
// Once third parties ship compiled binaries this project cannot rebuild or
// inspect, that distinction is the whole difference between a report that can
// be acted on and a wild goose chase through framework code that was working
// correctly. A handle is (generation << 8) | (slot + 1); resolving checks the
// generation still matches, so a stale handle returns cleanly and the mod that
// held it too long is the thing that gets named. Zero is never valid.
//
// The caller-owned name buffer and the uint32_t returns below are the same
// argument applied to smaller things: each turns a silent misbehaviour at the
// boundary into something a bug report can point at.

// a different game version, a different region, a corrected piece of RE - it
// reads someone else's memory and there is nothing anyone can do about it from
// this side.
//
// It stays available because there is real work that needs it and being unable
// to do that work is worse. But it is a VISIBLE choice: the name is Unsafe, and

// out rather than leaving it discoverable only by reading a mod's source - which
// for a compiled binary means not at all.
